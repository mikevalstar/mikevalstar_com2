## First Blog Post On The New Site

Yeah, I did it again, I'm starting a new site and this is it. 
I'm going to start writing out the latest and greatest stuff I'm learning and doing for myself.

This site will be the focus of a bunch of posts, 
static site generation, the benifits and even how a static site can be better for APIs in some instances.
